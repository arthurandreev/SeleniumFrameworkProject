# SeleniumFrameworkProject
This is a living project with functionality that will be extended regularly to allow me to advance my knowledge of latest web testing tools and best practices. 

## MVP
- Navigation and manipulation of web elements
- Have test setup and test teardown that are run after each scenario
- Have one specflow feature with at least 2 scenarios

## Possible Extensions:
- Add screenshot taking capability to the project
- Extend the project to allow for cross browser testing
- Host the project on a cloud hosting platform to enable automated nightly testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Extend the project to integrate Selenium Grid into the project to allow parallel running of tests on Azure servers
